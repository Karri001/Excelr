That's my lunch – and dinner – sorted for the next two days, all thanks to the power of meal prepping.\n> \n> This week's masterpiece?  Tender teriyaki chicken, vibrant red and orange carrots,  a healthy dose of broccoli, and fluffy white rice.  It's a flavor explosion in every bite, and the best part?  It's healthy and super convenient.\n> \n> My journey with meal prepping hasn't always been this picture-perfect.  It started with a chaotic mess of half-finished recipes and forgotten leftovers.  I'd spend my evenings scrambling to find something to eat, often resorting to unhealthy takeout.  Then, I decided enough was enough.\n> \n> I started small, prepping just one meal a week.  I learned to plan my meals around what I enjoyed and what was readily available. I experimented with different recipes, discovering that simple is often best.  This teriyaki chicken recipe is a testament to that!  It’s quick, easy, and delivers big on flavor.\n> \n> Slowly but surely, my meal prepping became a habit, a routine. Now, I spend a couple of hours on the weekend prepping my lunches and dinners for the entire week. The payoff is incredible – more time, more energy, and healthier eating habits!  It’s so worth it to avoid the afternoon slump and those last-minute unhealthy decisions.\n> \n> So, if you’re considering embarking on your own meal prep journey, I say go for it!  Start small, find recipes you love, and don't be afraid to experiment.  Soon, you’ll be enjoying your own beautiful, colorful containers, filled with delicious and nutritious meals.  And trust me, that feeling is unbeatable!\n"

            " This YouTube video is an introduction to machine learning.  The speaker defines machine learning as learning from data, a subfield of artificial intelligence that creates smarter applications.  The video covers various applications (speech recognition, web search, recommendation systems, computer vision, fraud detection, information retrieval), types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning), and algorithms of machine learning.  Supervised learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes (classification for categorical data, regression for continuous data); unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to find patterns (clustering, dimensionality reduction); and reinforcement learning involves an agent learning through trial and error and rewards/penalties.  The video also details the process of building a machine learning model, including data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, encoding, feature selection), algorithm selection, model building, and evaluation.  The speaker promises future videos with hands-on case studies and algorithm implementations using the Iris dataset as an example.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Core Concept:** Machine learning is about learning from data.  It's a subfield of AI that allows systems to learn from past data (training data or experience) without explicit programming.  The learned patterns are then used to make predictions about future events.\n",
            "* **Key Components:** Training data, machine learning algorithms, and a resulting model that makes predictions.\n",
            "* **Definitions:**  The video offers several definitions, highlighting the iterative improvement of performance based on experience.  Arthur Samuel's definition (\"giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\") is mentioned.\n",

            "    * **Regression:** Predicting continuous outputs (e.g., predicting house prices, salary).\n",
            "* **Unsupervised Learning:** The training data lacks labeled outputs. The algorithm explores the data's structure to find patterns (e.g., clustering customers into groups).  Examples include clustering analysis and dimensionality reduction.\n",
            "* **Reinforcement Learning:** An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. This is commonly used in game playing and robotics.\n",

            "3. **Model Training:** Applying the chosen algorithm to the training data to create a model.\n",
